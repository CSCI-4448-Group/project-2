we will need an abstract method in Item that can produce a pure string representation of the items type so a customer can come in asking for a "CD" as a string. public String to_type_string_rep();    or use java reflection

orderedItems_ has to be a <Item,Int> map from item to num days until arrival or set it to calendar day its supposed to arrive 

ordereditems_ will be <int,List<Item>> map from calendar date to list of itemi.e. from day to list of items that arrive on that day

object.getClass.getName/getCanonicalName

Damage percentage fxn

damage item fxn

static map of clerk to damage chance in clerk class

change conditions to have a static set of valid conditions, and then in each big if branch we can just check if its in the set of valid

Implement enumerated conditions

should have isValidCondition fxn, whose only job is to check the conditon
